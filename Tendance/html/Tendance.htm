                <h2>About Southwest GOA Port </h2>
                <p>Incorporated in 1997, South West Port marks a major milestone in the history of JSW Infrastructure as it is the company’s first port operation. South West Port provides vital logistic support to the JSW Steel plant at Vijayanagar, Karnataka.A mechanized terminal facility in Goa on the west coast of India, it was established primarily to handle the logistic needs of the JSW Steel plant at Toranagallu, Karnataka. With the expansion of the steel plant requiring larger movements of cargo, setting up its own terminal became a strategic cost-cutting and efficiency measure for the JSW Group.
